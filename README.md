# ETL process for GBC Superstore using mySQL


Problem statement:
The GBC superstore, a fictitious online retail store in the United States, aims to generate operational and executive reports to gain valuable insights into its business performance. 

We developed a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project that utilized SQL scripts to generate these reports. The reports provided comprehensive data analysis derived from a high-quality MySQL database, incorporating calculations, key performance indicators (KPIs), ratios, and other relevant metrics. The successful implementation of this project enabled GBC superstore to make informed decisions and drive strategic improvements in its operations and overall business performance.
